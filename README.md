# Loan-Prediction-with-Various-ML-Models
# 1. Introduction 

## Data Set Problems 

The company seeks **to automate (in real time) the loan qualifying procedure** based on information given by customers while filling out an online application form. It is expected that the development of ML models that can help the company predict loan approval in **accelerating decision-making process** for determining whether an applicant is eligible for a loan or not.

## Objectives of Notebook 
 **This notebook aims to:**
*   Analyze customer data provided in data set (EDA)
*   Build various ML models that can predict loan approval

 **The machine learning models used in this project are:** 
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Naive Bayes
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. Gradient Boost

## Data Set Description 
There are **13 variables** in this data set:
*   **8 categorical** variables,
*   **4 continuous** variables, and
*   **1** variable to accommodate the loan ID.


 The following is the **structure of the data set**.
